## Project Overview
Project J & K is a collaborative effort to explore both algorithmic problem-solving and web programming. The project is divided into two main tracks: algorithms and web programming.

## Algorithms üß†
The algorithms part of the project is set to be completed by November. We are focusing on Python and C/C++ for algorithmic problem-solving. In this phase, we will be working on various algorithms and data structures, enhancing our problem-solving skills.

## Web Programming üíª
The web programming phase will commence in September. Technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with other relevant tools, will be used to build web applications. This phase will allow us to apply our programming knowledge to real-world projects.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
No specific setup is required for this project. Each member can use their preferred development environment for both algorithms and web programming. Collaboration and communication tools will be used to coordinate efforts and share progress.

## Timeline üìÖ
- **Algorithms Phase:** In progress, targeted completion by November.
- **Web Programming Phase:** Scheduled to start in September.

Feel free to explore each track independently or collaborate across both tracks. Regular communication and collaboration are encouraged to make the most out of this learning experience.

Happy coding! üéâ
